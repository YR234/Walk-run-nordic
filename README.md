Synthetic Time series data generator is the open source code from the the paper "Transfer learning in time series classification using synthetic data generation"

## Install
Clone repository, then:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
All of the code is well documented. </br>
We strongly reccomend to see our [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/YR234/TL-for-TSC/blob/main/starter_tutorial.ipynb) for a simple explaination on how to use our generator.</br>

## Our own 15,000,000 time series generated synthetic data
Our data is available for the community at: [Synthetic data](https://github.com/YR234/TL-for-TSC/tree/main/synthetic%20data)

## Citation
Please cite the following manuscript when using this code: "Transfer learning in time series classification using synthetic data generation" (link will be added with acceptance)
