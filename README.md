## Report
My full report can be found here: [Report](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PqlzmYjh5yLe6AExqtwQBd1vPus9SbJP?usp=sharing). The report includs: installation, imports, eda, preprocess, model training and results evaluation.

## Important note
Along the report there are some insights I wrote. All the consideration I took (like data cleaning, etc.) was chosen due to time consideration, however many more could be done.
